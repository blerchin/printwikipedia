		<i>From Aaaaa! to ZZZap!</i><br />
		an exhibition by Michael Mandiberg<br />
		at Denny Gallery, 261 Broome St.<br />
		featuring work from the <i>Print Wikipedia</i> series<br />
		June 18 to July 2, 2015<br />
		opening June 18th, 6-8PM
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>Print Wikipedia</i> is a both a utilitarian visualization of the
		largest accumulation of human knowledge and a poetic gesture
		towards the futility of the scale of big data. Mandiberg has
		written software that parses the entirety of the English-language
		Wikipedia database and programmatically lays out thousands of
		volumes, complete with covers, and then uploads them for
		print-on-demand. Built on what is likely the largest
		appropriation ever made, it is also a work of found poetry that
		draws attention to the sheer size of the encyclopedia’s content
		and the impossibility of rendering Wikipedia as a material object
		in fixed form: Once a volume is printed it is already out of
		date. The work is also a reflection on the actual transparency or
		completeness of knowledge containers and history.
		</p>
		<p>
		The exhibition at Denny Gallery will be the performance of the
		upload of <i>Print Wikipedia</i> to <a
			href="http://lulu.com">Lulu.com</a> (a print-on-demand
		website), and exhibition of a selection of volumes from the
		project. The upload process will take between eleven and fourteen
		days, during which time, the upload process will be on continuous
		view. In addition, the gallery will remain open around the clock
		through the first weekend of the exhibition, in recognition that
		the computer itself works continuously. There will be two
		channels for watching this process: a projection of the Lulu.com
		site in a web browser and a computer monitor with the command
		line updates showing the dialogue between the code and the site.
		The script will also post to Twitter after it finishes each
		volume. Individual volumes and the entirety of <i>Print
			Wikipedia</i>,
		<i>Wikipedia Table of Contents</i>, and <i>Wikipedia Contributor
			Appendix</i>
		will be available for sale. The build and upload process will
		take place in real time; until this process begins, exact metrics
		for the scale of the work can only be estimated.
